Error logs are generated in the format GunGame<version>_Log<configuration#>.txt

    EventScripts), the current errorlog will be copied into:
                    GunGame<version>_Log[1].txt
    If the configuration is changed yet again, you will see:
                    GunGame<version>_Log.txt
                    GunGame<version>_Log[1].txt
                    GunGame<version>_Log[2].txt
